# What is Parquet file format?
Apache Parquet is an open source file format that stores data in columnar format (as opposed to row format). As a columnar data storage format, it offers several advantages over row-based formats for analytical workloads. Your choice of data format can have significant implications for query performance and cost, so itâ€™s important to understand the differences between Apache Parquet and other file formats.
